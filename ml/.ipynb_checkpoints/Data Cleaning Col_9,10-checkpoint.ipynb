The home automation device that you build can be integrated with almost all the home appliances and can be used to control them remotely from any part of the world.\\n\\nTo facilitate the wireless connectivity with the system, the Arduino Uno will be embedded with a WiFi module. This establishes the internet connection to the system and all the home appliances can in turn be connected and controlled by internet.The device can also be connected to an Android App which you can develop on your own using some applications like MIT App inventor etc. By using this app, you will be able to monitor and control the home appliances from any part of the world with ease.\\n\\nYou can also include a PIR sensor with this project to make it switch ON automatically the appliances whenever a person enters the room and switch OFF the appliances whenever the person leaves the room.\\n          Arduino Uno: The digital and analog input/output pins are equipped in boards that may be interfaced to various expansion boards and other circuits. Serial communication interface is a feature in this board, including USB which will be used to load the programs from computer.\\nVoltage regulator: It is used to maintain a constant voltage level and also used for regulating AC or DC voltages. A voltage regulator contain negative feed-forward design or it may also contain negative feedback control loops.\\nWiFi Module: ESP8266 WiFi module is generally used to establish the wireless communication between the devices. But this module is not capable of 5-3V logic shifting and will require an external logic level converter.\\nPIR Sensor: It is capable of sensing motion of the human and therefore it is also called as a motion sensor. Whenever a human pass through this sensor it will automatically sense the motion through IR radiation and send the data to the microcontroller.\\nRelay Driver (IC ULN2803 APG): The relay driver IC that you use will have the following characteristics, 500-mA rated collector current, High voltage outputs – 50 V, Output clamp diodes, Inputs compatible with various types of logic.',\n",
